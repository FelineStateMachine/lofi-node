# Tickets explained

<!-- Source: FelineStateMachine/lofi-node docs/app-ticket.md (the normative contract) and
     src/ticket.ts; lofi package/runtime/data-sink.ts for the app side. -->

lofi-node uses two kinds of ticket, and confusing them is the most common early stumble. This guide
is the conceptual tour; the [app-ticket contract](/node/docs/app-ticket) is the normative spec the
lofi side implements against.

## Two ticket kinds

- A **node-pairing ticket** (`endpoint…`) is an iroh endpoint address. It names a _node_ so another
  node can dial it. It is used by `lofi-node pair` and never by browsers or apps.
- An **app-connect ticket** (`lofisync1.…`) is the credential _you_ hand to a lofi app so it syncs
  against your node. It carries the store's app id and the gate URL with a 256-bit secret embedded
  in its path.

## Why the secret lives in the URL path

A header was the obvious alternative and it does not survive contact with the platform: the
browser's WebSocket API cannot set request headers, so a header-borne credential would need a
different authentication path for exactly the connection that matters most. Jazz clients preserve a
base path in their server URL and reject query parameters. By making the ticket's URL
`http(s)://host:port/t/<secret>`, every request the client ever makes — sync WebSocket connects,
catalogue reads, admin calls — carries the secret with **zero client changes**. The cost of the
choice is that the secret rides in a URL, which is why proxy access logs need
[redaction](beyond-the-lan.md) and why the gate compares digests rather than logging paths. The gate
validates the secret (timing-safe, digest against digest), strips the prefix, and proxies to the
loopback-only Jazz server. The lofi app uses the ticket URL verbatim as its sync server; that is the
whole integration.

## Scopes

- **`sync`** (the default, and what an absent scope means — every pre-scope ticket keeps meaning
  transport-only): sync, catalogue reads that transport needs, and the metadata-only `store-status`
  preflight. Admin routes answer the same `401 {"error":"invalid_ticket"}` as an unknown secret, so
  a probe learns nothing.
- **`provision`**: a strict superset — everything above plus store administration. The gate injects
  the node's own `X-Jazz-Admin-Secret` for provisioning requests and strips any inbound one, so the
  admin secret never transits the client. Possession of a provision ticket **is** the
  store-administration opt-in; issue one per provisioning context, not per device.

A ticket with an unrecognized scope is rejected outright by the lofi parser — never silently granted
less than it claims.

## Revocation

- The node stores only SHA-256 digests; the ticket string is displayable once, at issuance.
- Unknown and revoked secrets are indistinguishable to probers: both get
  `401 {"error":"invalid_ticket"}`, on HTTP and on the WebSocket upgrade.
- Revoking a ticket mid-session closes its live WebSockets with close code **4001** within a couple
  of seconds. The app treats the stored sink as dead and surfaces re-enrollment — it never silently
  retries forever.

## The security posture, honestly

An app ticket is a **bearer credential** with 256-bit entropy. Anyone holding it can sync as an
authorized transport peer; identity and row-level permissions remain Jazz's local-first layer on
top, enforced by the deployed policy, not by the ticket. Plain http is acceptable on a trusted LAN;
beyond one, front the gate with TLS — installed PWAs generally require a secure origin anyway. Issue
tickets per device or context so revocation is scoped.

## What the app does with it

You paste; the app does the rest. The ticket is validated (against the same rules this node
enforces; the two repos share machine-readable conformance fixtures), declared as the device's sync
location, and sync is elected in one step. The app keeps the ticket URL in a sealed device-local
record (encrypted at rest under a device-bound key) and never surfaces it through its session
snapshot — only the host and your label show. A provision ticket gets split first: the app asks the
node for a derived sync ticket to store, and the provision original is either sealed behind your
passkey or kept only in memory with your password manager holding the durable copy. The derived
ticket is linked to its parent — revoking the provision ticket revokes it too. For app developers,
the framework call behind that paste is `enrollSyncTicket`, documented in
[Sync and recovery](/docs/sync-and-recovery).
